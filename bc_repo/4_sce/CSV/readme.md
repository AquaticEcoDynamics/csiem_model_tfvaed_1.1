<br>

This folder contains the boundary condition for Swan-Canning Estuary inflows and water quality (for Upper Swan inflows through Narrows Bridge and Canning river inflows, interpolated from nearby tidal gauge and water quality monitoring), and processed for use by the TUFLOW-FV Cockburn Sound model.

Files in this folder include (by Apr 2023):

```
NAR_Inflow_20100101_20230101_wq.csv
Canning_Inflow_20100101_20230101_wq.csv
```

These files are not stored in GitHub and can be accessed from the CSIEM model archive on Pawsey:

```

```
