## Cockburn Sound model : waves (WWM) boundary condition files

<br>

This folder contains the outputs from the wave model developed by the UWA Oceans Institute for Perth region, and processed for use by the TUFLOW-FV Cockburn Sound model.

The files include wave variables specific to the CSIEM model domain.

Files in this folder include (by Apr 2023):

```
WWM_Agrid_UTC+0_20150101_20151231.nc
WWM_Bgrid_UTC+0_20150101_20151231.nc
WWM_Cgrid_UTC+0_20150101_20151231.nc
WWM_Agrid_UTC+0_20220101_20221231.nc
WWM_Bgrid_UTC+0_20220101_20221231.nc
WWM_Cgrid_UTC+0_20220101_20221231.nc
```

Note that three resolutions are available and processed, which cover different regions of model domain. The finest resolution (SWAN_C_HIND) covers the Cockburn Sound area of interest.

These files are not stored in GitHub and can be accessed from the CSIEM model archive on Pawsey:
