## Cockburn Sound model : ocean boundary condition files (biogeochemistry)

<br>

This folder contains the outputs from analysis undertaken of ocean biogeochemical variables in Perth offshore waters for the purposes of specifying ocean boundary condition values required for the AED biogeochemical model.

The files include time-series of oxygen, nutrients and plankton specific to the CSIEM model domain boundary.

Scripts for creating the ocean BGC time-series are available within the [csiem model tools Github repo](https://github.com/AquaticEcoDynamics/csiem_model_tools/tree/main/preprocess/obc).

Files in this folder include (by Apr 2023):

```
ocean_bgc_a_20130101_20131231.csv
ocean_bgc_a_20150101_20151231.csv
ocean_bgc_IMOS_20220101_20221231.csv
```

These files are not stored in GitHub and can be accessed from the CSIEM model archive on Pawsey:

```

```

For more information on the CSIEM model setup, please visit the model documentation [here](https://aquaticecodynamics.github.io/csiem-science/) (note: currently under development).
