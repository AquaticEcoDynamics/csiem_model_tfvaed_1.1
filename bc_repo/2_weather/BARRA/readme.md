<br>

This folder contains the outputs from the BARRA weather reanalysis dataset, processed for use by the TUFLOW-FV Cockburn Sound model. For more information about this data set please refer to the [Bureau of Meteorology's BARRA Reanalysis](https://http://www.bom.gov.au/research/projects/reanalysis/) page.

The files include weather variables specific to the CSIEM model domain.

Original BARRA outputs are available from :

https://dapds00.nci.org.au/thredds/catalog/cj37/BARRA/BARRA_PH/v1/forecast

Scripts for processing the BARRA outputs into a reduced NC file for TUFLOW-FV are available from:

https://gitlab.com/tuflow-user-group/tuflow-fv/data-pre-processing/get-atmos

Files in this folder include (by Apr 2023):

```
BARRA_PH_UTC+8_20130101_20131231.nc
BARRA_PH_UTC+8_20150101_20151231.nc

- BARRA_PH (1.5km resolution over South-West WA) for the period 1990-01-01 to 2019-02-28

These files are not stored in GitHub and can be accessed from the CSIEM model archive on Pawsey:
